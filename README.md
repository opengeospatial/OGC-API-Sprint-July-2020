About the Sprint
----------------

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) invites interested developers to the July 2020 OGC API Sprint, to be held through remote participation/web-conferencing from 28th to 29th July 2020. The sprint will cover the draft [OGC API - Maps](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/maps) specification.

The draft [OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/maps) specification defines a Web API for requesting map images over the Internet. OGC API - Maps makes it easy for a client to request images, changing parameters such as size and coordinate reference systems at the time of request. A server that implements OGC API - Maps provides information about what maps it offers, as well as producing a map and answering queries about the content of the maps. OGC API - Maps is expected to address use cases similar to those addressed by the Web Map Service (WMS) standard.
