*OGC API - Maps Virtual Code Sprint - How it went!*

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) hosted a virtual code sprint to advance the draft OGC API - Maps specification on July 28th-29th 2020.
The sprint was sponsored by Ordnance Survey. The participants prototyped implementations of the draft OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core
specification, identifying missing requirements, and documenting these requirements so that the specification could be tested and improved. An
OGC Sprint is a collaborative and inclusive event driven by innovative and rapid programming with minimal process and organization constraints
to support the development of new applications and open standards.

The draft OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core specification defines a Web API for requesting map images over the Internet. OGC API - Maps makes it
easy for a client application to request images, changing parameters such as size and coordinate reference systems at the time of request. A
server that implements OGC API - Maps provides information about available maps, as well as producing a map and answering queries about
the content of the maps. The draft specification comes from OGC’s concerted effort to create modular, resource-oriented API standards that
use OpenAPI for describing interfaces that offer geographic information over the web - known collectively as the OGC API family of standards.

The Centre for Ecological Research and Forestry Applications (CREAF) at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) deployed an instance of the
MiraMon Map Server in preparation for the sprint (http://ogc.uab.cat/OGCMapSprint/[http://ogc.uab.cat/OGCMapSprint]).
The server implements support for the draft OGC API - Maps specification. The server is implemented as a CGI application encoded in
C language that is part of the MiraMon Geographic Information System (GIS) & Remote Sensing (RS) suite. It can interoperate with other
vendors clients and provides additional functionality when combined with the MiraMon Map Client.

In preparation for the sprint, CubeWerx deployed an implementation of OGC API - Maps and other OGC API specifications
(https://test.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv/demo/ogcapi/Daraa[https://test.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv/demo/ogcapi/Daraa]).
The CubeWerx server ("cubeserv") is implemented in the C programming language. The server exposes an interactive API description created from
the OpenAPI definition document. This enables both users and client applications to query the server. During the sprint, the server was
updated in real time based on feedback from other participants using the services.

In preparation for the sprint, Ecere also deployed an implementation of OGC API - Maps that also supported a number of other OGC API
specifications (http://maps.ecere.com/geoapi/[http://maps.ecere.com/geoapi/]). The implementation had been built on top of Ecere's GNOSIS Map Server
product which uses the open-source cross-platform Ecere SDK and eC programming language. Amongst the maps published through the GNOSIS Map
Server during the sprint was a subset of Ordnance Survey's OpenMapLocal product
(https://os.uk/business-government/products/open-map-local[https://os.uk/business-government/products/open-map-local]),
which was exposed as a http://maps.ecere.com/geoapi/collections/OpenMapLocal[map collection].

Sigma Bravo extended the OpenSphere plugin to support OGC API - Maps (https://frozen-lime.surge.sh[https://frozen-lime.surge.sh]).
OpenSphere is a pluggable, single-page, GIS web application that supports both 2D and 3D views. It supports binding to many popular
servers and formats. Other features include animation of both raster and vector data, import and export of various formats, and saving files and
layers between sessions.

The draft OGC API - Maps specification is expected to address use cases similar to those addressed by the OGC Web Map Service (WMS) standard. As
such one of the prototype implementations demonstrated how to create a facade or proxy that exposes a WMS through an OGC API - Maps interface.
Development of the prototype was used as the basis for developing a https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Sprint-July-2020/blob/master/docs/Draft_Spring_Guide_for_OGC_API_Maps/Draft_Spring_Guide_for_OGC_API_Maps.adoc[basic
guide] for developers that use the Sprint Framework (spring.io) - a popular framework for Java developers. The prototype implementation
published a http://sandy-gh-1.ogc.org:8081/collections/os_open_zoomstack_subset/map/default?bbox=-0.12430460067838463,51.52024185677388,-0.08639925712829871,51.53989269334246&width=768&height=632&crs=CRS:84&f=image/png[map]
created from the Ordnance Survey’s OS Open Zoomstack product (https://os.uk/business-government/products/open-zoomstack[https://os.uk/business-government/products/open-zoomstack]).
