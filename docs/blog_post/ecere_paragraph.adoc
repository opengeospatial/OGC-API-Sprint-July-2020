In preparation for the sprint, Ecere deployed an implementation of OGC API - Maps that also supported a number of other OGC API
specifications (http://maps.ecere.com/ogcapi/[http://maps.ecere.com/ogcapi/]). The implementation had been built on top of Ecere's GNOSIS Map Server
product which uses the open-source cross-platform Ecere SDK and eC programming language. Amongst the maps published through the GNOSIS Map
Server during the sprint was the entire Ordnance Survey's OpenMapLocal product
(https://os.uk/business-government/products/open-map-local[https://os.uk/business-government/products/open-map-local]),
which was exposed as a http://maps.ecere.com/ogcapi/collections/OpenMapLocal[map collection].
