In preparation for the sprint, CubeWerx deployed an implementation of OGC API - Maps and other OGC API specifications
(https://test.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv/demo/ogcapi/Daraa[https://test.cubewerx.com/cubewerx/cubeserv/demo/ogcapi/Daraa]).
The CubeWerx server ("cubeserv") is implemented in the C programming language. The server exposes an interactive API description created from
the OpenAPI definition document. This enables both users and client applications to query the server. During the sprint, the server was
updated in real time based on feedback from other participants using the services.
