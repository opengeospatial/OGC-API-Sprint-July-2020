*Q3 2020 OGC API - Maps Virtual Code Sprint - How it went!*

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) hosted a virtual code sprint to advance the draft OGC API - Maps specification on July 28th-29th 2020.
The sprint was sponsored by Ordnance Survey. The participants prototyped implementations of the draft OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core
specification, identifying missing requirements, and documenting these requirements so that the specification could be tested and improved. An
OGC Sprint is a collaborative and inclusive event driven by innovative and rapid programming with minimal process and organization constraints
to support the development of new applications and open standards.

The draft OGC API - Maps - Part 1: Core specification defines a Web API for requesting map images over the Internet. OGC API - Maps makes it
easy for a client application to request images, changing parameters such as size and coordinate reference systems at the time of request. A
server that implements OGC API - Maps provides information about available maps, as well as producing a map and answering queries about
the content of the maps. The draft specification comes from OGC’s concerted effort to create modular, resource-oriented API standards that
use OpenAPI for describing interfaces that offer geographic information over the web - known collectively as the OGC API family of standards.

The draft OGC API - Maps specification is expected to address use cases similar to those addressed by the OGC Web Map Service (WMS) standard. As
such one of the prototype implementations demonstrated how to create a facade or proxy that exposes a WMS through an OGC API - Maps interface.
Development of the prototype was used as the basis for developing a https://github.com/opengeospatial/OGC-API-Sprint-July-2020/blob/master/docs/Draft_Spring_Guide_for_OGC_API_Maps/Draft_Spring_Guide_for_OGC_API_Maps.adoc[basic
guide] for developers that use the Sprint Framework (spring.io) - a popular framework for Java developers. The prototype implementation
